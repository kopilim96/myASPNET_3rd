# myASPNET_3rd

Yeah I am still learning on ASP.NET Core and this Project is followed from the 

Official Microsoft Tutorial --> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/?view=aspnetcore-3.1

In this Project, there will be 

- CRUD (its basic)
- Code-First 
- Db Migration
- Microsoft ASP Net scaffold-dbcontext
- EF using Linq to handle SQL query to db
- Handle Concurrency (I am not good at this)

*It required good understand on the logic behind and some English stuff
